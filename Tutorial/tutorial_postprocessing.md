# Postprocessing 

Postprocessing is the final step, where we read in, aggregate, and interpret the simulation results. You can conduct postprocessing using any tools you like. Our team also has an R library with predefined functions for postprocessing simulation results. (Github repo [here](https://github.com/BershteynLab/EMODAnalyzeR/tree/main).)

[Here](https://rstudio.hpc.nyumc.org/) is a tool for running a remote RStudio server on BigPurple. Start a "Standard R Job" with R version 4.0 or later. An RStudio server will open in your browser. From there, you can open [this notebook](tutorial_postprocessing.rmd) to get started with postprocessing. (You have the option of running postprocessing locally on your own machine, but it's not recommended as it would require downloading many gigabytes of files.)
